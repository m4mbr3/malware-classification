***Malware Classification Project***

**Goal**

This project aims to build and compare various malware classifier based on the Microsoft
Kaggle dataset. The features used in this project are statically extracted and
are the following:

    File Size
    PE Binary Segments (e.g. .data, .text, .rodata)
    Count of Operations (e.g. # of calls performed, # of jmps, # of mov etc.)
    Strings contained by the binary
    Number of Basic Block


**Classifier Used**

    SVM
    Neural Networks
    Random Forest

**File Description**

    malclass.py: contains the struct used for features extraction and
    normalization

    converter.py: modifies the bytes file in a format that allows better
    performance during the features extraction

    extract_features.py: scripts that runs over the dataset and extract the
    features and save them in output.txt in json format. It requires the strings
    to be modified by converted.py first.

    normalizer.py: runs over output.txt and normalize the various features
    prior training

    classifier_trainer.py: brute-force the parameters for each of the classifier using the
    grid search.

    tester.py: perfoms the 10 fold cross-validation using for each classifier
    the best settings found by train.py

    results: contains the results in txt format

    matrix.mtx and list.mtx contains the matrix with the features vector and the
    labels vector respectively

    final_report: contains the latex source code for the report

    model folders: contains the various saved model for the best settings
    trained on the split 33/67
