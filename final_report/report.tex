\section*{Problem definition}

In recent years, the malware growth and distribution reached unthinkable levels.
A 2015 report\cite{trendmicro} from TrendMicro reveals that almost 1 million
samples are discovered on daily base. Given these numbers, it is easy to realize
that a manual approach to handle this immense flow of new threats is absolutely
unbearable. Therefore, since beginning of 2000 researcher have been trying to
apply automatic techniques to help to catch up with this huge growth.

Several approaches has been proposed, covering the huge spectrum that goes from
static to dynamic analysis. In malware analysis, static approaches tend
to suffer because packing and encryption. Malware authors employ these techniques
to prevent fast and reliable reverse engineering and or automatic analysis on
the malware binary. On the other hand, dynamic analysis is instead
able to deal with these techniques but suffer of code coverage issues. Most of
the time malware relies on specific inputs or time conditions to trigger
the malice behaviours.

Given the complexity of deployment of most of the dynamic or static analysis
techniques, researchers have also tried to apply machine learning techniques to
the process to easier the analysis and classification of the samples. In this
case, researchers exploited the key idea that most of the samples discovered has
commonalities with previous discovered samples. Machine learning can help to
pre-filter malware based on certain features and classify them in the respective
family leaving only a smaller subset of unknown malware to be analyzed to the
analysts.


In general, it is fair to assume that the number of malware families is largely
smaller compared the number of samples discovered. Most of the new samples
represents updated version of what was already known in the past. This offer
good ground for machine learning approaches.Previously, machine learning
approaches such as \cite{torsten} applied classification on malware. Others,
such as \cite{something} applied un-supervised learning methodology to cluster
similar malware without having previous ground truth. All these works
concentrate mostly on dynamic features due to the encryption and packing.


In this project, I tackle the problem of malware classification using a complete
set of static features. This will allow a fast and inexpensive analysis to
pre-filter malware in the respective families. For this work I use the publicly
available Microsoft Kaggle Database which offers a large collection (10800
samples) of malware divided in 9 families. For each sample, the database contains
the bytes and the IDApro disassembled view of the malware.


\section*{Dataset Description}

In this work, I used the publicly available malware dataset offered by Microsoft
for the malware classification challenge competition held between February and
April 2015. It contains 9 different families of malware showed in Table
\ref{tab:samples}. The dataset contains a total of 10868 samples. The dataset
contains also other 17GB of data which goal was to test the various algorithms
during the competition. I do not use that part of the dataset in this project
since unlabeled.

The dataset offers for each sample two distinct files. It contains a
\textit{bytes} file which provides the hexdump of the sample (without the PE
header) and a IDApro disassembled file which contains the assembly code in Intel
syntax and other useful information (e.g. section names, sub routine start and
end etc.). Every sample in the database is not encrypted and not packed. I
explicitly exploit this characteristic of the dataset to extract static features
that otherwise I would not be able to use. I do not extract any dynamic features
(e.g. time of execution or operation triggered by certain inputs) because every
sample misses the PE header preventing me its execution.
